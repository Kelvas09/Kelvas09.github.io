            "response": "By default the KVFaq framework uses its own cell. However, you can modify it by overloading the 'faqItemCellName' method and indicating the name of the cell to use. It is up to you to load the cell if it is not present in the tableView."

            "response": "With the 'forceRebuildList' method you can rebuild the list. If you use a variable to select the name of the file or the URL of the file, you can then display a FAQ according to several parameters."
